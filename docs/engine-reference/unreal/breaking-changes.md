# Unreal Engine 5.8 — Breaking Changes

**Last verified:** 2026-08-16

This document tracks breaking API changes and behavioral differences between Unreal Engine 5.3
(likely in model training) and Unreal Engine 5.8 (current version). Organized by risk level.

## HIGH RISK — Will Break Existing Code

### Substrate Material System (Production-Ready in 5.7)
**Versions:** UE 5.5+ (experimental), 5.7 (production-ready)

Substrate replaces the legacy material system with a modular, physically accurate framework.

```cpp
// ❌ OLD: Legacy material nodes (still work but deprecated)
// Standard material graph with Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, etc.

// ✅ NEW: Substrate material layers
// Use Substrate nodes: Substrate Slab, Substrate Blend, etc.
// Modular material authoring with true physical accuracy
```

**Migration:** Enable Substrate in `Project Settings > Engine > Substrate` and rebuild materials using Substrate nodes.

---

### PCG (Procedural Content Generation) API Overhaul
**Versions:** UE 5.7 (production-ready)

PCG framework reached production-ready status with major API changes.

```cpp
// ❌ OLD: Experimental PCG API (pre-5.7)
// Old node types, unstable API

// ✅ NEW: Production PCG API (5.7+)
// Use FPCGContext, IPCGElement, new node types
// Stable API, production-ready workflow
```

**Migration:** Follow PCG migration guide in 5.7 docs. Expect significant refactoring for experimental PCG code.

---

### Megalights Rendering System
**Versions:** UE 5.5+ (experimental), 5.8 (production-ready)

New lighting system supports massive numbers of dynamic, shadow-casting lights.
Production-ready in 5.8 with reduced noise, transmission support, froxel
translucency, and new debugging tools. Targets 60fps on current-gen consoles.

```cpp
// ❌ OLD: Limited dynamic lights (clustered forward shading)
// Max ~100-200 dynamic lights before performance degrades

// ✅ NEW: Megalights (production-ready in 5.8)
// Hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting area lights with minimal noise
// Enable: Project Settings > Engine > Rendering > Megalights
```

**Migration:** No code changes needed, but lighting behavior may differ. Test scenes after enabling.

---

### C++ Toolchain: Visual Studio 2026 / MSVC v145 Required
**Versions:** UE 5.8

UBT rejects VS2022's MSVC v143 toolset with:
`"Visual Studio compiler version 14.38.x is not a preferred version. Please use the latest preferred version 14.50.x"`

```csharp
// ✅ NEW: Required .Target.cs settings for 5.8 (both game and Editor targets)
DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V7;
IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_8;
```

**Migration:** Install VS2026 (MSVC v145). Delete `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`,
`DerivedDataCache/`, `.vs/`, and `.sln`, then regenerate project files. If the
built project won't launch after a successful compile, install
`Engine/Extras/Redist/en-us/vc_redist.x64.exe` from the 5.8 install.

---

### WASAPI Is the Default Windows Audio Backend
**Versions:** UE 5.8

Windows audio switched from XAudio2 to WASAPI. XAudio2 is now an opt-in fallback
via config. Projects using native audio APIs or audio middleware must re-verify
their Windows audio path.

**Migration:** Test audio on Windows after upgrading. Opt back into XAudio2 via
config only if a middleware incompatibility is found.

---

## MEDIUM RISK — Behavioral Changes

### Zenserver Configuration Renames
**Versions:** UE 5.8

- `AllowRemoteNetworkService` renamed to `RemoteNetworkService` with new enum values (`None` / `Unsecured` / `GeneratedStaticKey`)
- Zenserver cooked output store is now the default; projects that had the Zen store disabled must manually re-enable/opt out in project settings
- `DefaultFastGeoStreaming.ini` replaces `FastGeoStreaming.ini`

---

### Sequencer Animation Section Looping Redefined
**Versions:** UE 5.8

Section looping now uses a completion-based model; `KeepState` / `RestoreState`
logic changed. Cinematics relying on precise loop/restore behavior need re-testing.

---

### OpenXR Stereo Layer Ordering
**Versions:** UE 5.8

Stereo layers are now priority-driven instead of fixed-order. Set
`xr.OpenXRSortFaceLockedLayersAboveOtherLayers=1` to restore pre-5.8 behavior.

---

### Enhanced Input System (Now Default)
**Versions:** UE 5.1+ (recommended), 5.7 (default), 5.8 (unified with CommonUI)

Enhanced Input is now the default input system. In 5.8, Enhanced Input and
CommonUI input are unified — duplicate input assets between the two systems
are eliminated.

```cpp
// ❌ OLD: Legacy input bindings (deprecated)
InputComponent->BindAction("Jump", IE_Pressed, this, &ACharacter::Jump);

// ✅ NEW: Enhanced Input
SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent) {
    UEnhancedInputComponent* EIC = Cast<UEnhancedInputComponent>(PlayerInputComponent);
    EIC->BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Started, this, &ACharacter::Jump);
}
```

**Migration:** Replace legacy input bindings with Enhanced Input actions.

---

### Nanite Default Enabled
**Versions:** UE 5.0+ (optional), 5.7 (encouraged)

Nanite virtualized geometry is now the recommended workflow for static meshes.

```cpp
// Enable Nanite on static mesh:
// Static Mesh Editor > Details > Nanite Settings > Enable Nanite Support
```

**Migration:** Convert high-poly meshes to Nanite. Test performance on target platforms.

---

## LOW RISK — Deprecations (Still Functional)

### Legacy Material System
**Status:** Deprecated but supported
**Replacement:** Substrate Material System

Legacy materials still work, but Substrate is recommended for new projects.

---

### Old World Partition (UE4 Style)
**Status:** Deprecated
**Replacement:** World Partition (UE5+)

Use UE5's World Partition system for large worlds.

---

## Platform-Specific Breaking Changes

### Windows
- **UE 5.7**: DirectX 12 is now default (was DX11 in older versions)
- Update shaders for DX12 compatibility
- **UE 5.8**: WASAPI default audio backend (XAudio2 opt-in); VS2026 / MSVC v145 required for C++

### macOS
- **UE 5.5+**: Metal 3 required (minimum macOS 13)

### Mobile
- **UE 5.7**: Minimum Android API level raised to 26 (Android 8.0)
- Minimum iOS deployment target raised to iOS 14
- **UE 5.8**: Multi-pass deferred rendering is the mobile default (forward is opt-in)

## Migration Checklist

When upgrading from UE 5.3 to UE 5.8:

- [ ] Review Substrate materials (convert if ready for new system)
- [ ] Audit PCG usage (update to production API if using experimental)
- [ ] Test Megalights performance (production-ready in 5.8 — enable and benchmark)
- [ ] Migrate legacy input to Enhanced Input
- [ ] Convert high-poly meshes to Nanite
- [ ] Update shaders for DX12 (Windows) or Metal 3 (macOS)
- [ ] Verify minimum platform versions (Android 8.0, iOS 14)
- [ ] Test Lumen and Nanite performance on target hardware

When upgrading from UE 5.7 to UE 5.8 (no hard breaking changes, but):

- [ ] Install VS2026 / MSVC v145; UBT rejects VS2022's v143
- [ ] Set `BuildSettingsVersion.V7` + `EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_8` in all `.Target.cs` files
- [ ] Delete `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `DerivedDataCache/`, `.vs/`, `.sln`; regenerate project files
- [ ] Inventory plugins (binary vs source); bump `.uplugin` EngineVersion
- [ ] Test Windows audio path (WASAPI now default)
- [ ] Re-test Sequencer cinematics relying on loop/`KeepState`/`RestoreState` behavior
- [ ] Full Blueprint compile pass; watch LogLinker; let shaders finish compiling before judging
- [ ] Fix deprecation warnings now — 5.8 is the last UE5 release before UE6
